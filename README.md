# Description
This project involves creating a MiniShell, a command-line interpreter that reads commands from the standard input and executes them. Key features include:

- Execution of commands separated by |.
- Input redirection (<), output redirection (>), and error redirection (>&).
- Background execution of commands ending with &.
- Built-in commands like cd, jobs, fg, exit, and umask.
- Handling of SIGINT signals without terminating the MiniShell.
